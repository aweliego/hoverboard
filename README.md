## Credits

I'm not the creator of this project, all credits go to @bradtraversy and the original code can be found in his [https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days](50projects50days repo).

I'm sharing this project as I wanted to expand on it on my own, by adding an option to select a color scheme and some responsiveness.
